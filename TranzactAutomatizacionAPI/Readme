1.- API Automation has been done with Framework Karate

2.- Ideally, it would be better to run the TestRunner file with JUNIT to run all the features. However, when I did that, the page generated an error
indicating that it exceeded the limit per user. The temporary solution that I could find is running the features independently.
Another solution could be to get the access_key between each execution, and check if the limit has been exceeded. If so, reset the value to
get a new one and continue running.

3.- At execution level, its common to create tags so the script only runs the selected ones and not necessary all of them.

4. All the feature validate the response with its linked json file

5.- BODY of the POST request only have 3 values. However, assuming the GET request, I added the other missing fields and decided to ignore them.
