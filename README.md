Inside there are 2 Projects. One Automation of UI and other for API. Inside each project there is a separate readmefile with comments.


-UI :its a Maven project of Selenium + Java. Simply run the Main class.


-API has been done with Framework Karate. Usually the TestRunner should run all the features, however, for this particular API it was failing because of limits of the account. I recomment to run each feature separate.
